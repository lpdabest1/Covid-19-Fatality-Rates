# The Effect of Hospital Capacity by State on Covid-19 Fatality Rates

#Abstract

For this study, I am analyzing/focusing on the relation between hospital capacity/utilization and 
Covid-19 fatality rates. I used a log-log regression model/approach to examine this relationship
for both variables (independent – hospital capacity, dependent – Covid-19 fatality rate). I had 
done so with data collected from all the states in the United States (51 states) for all the variables 
of interest. Furthermore, the results show that there is a positive correlation between Hospital 
Capacity and Covid-19 Fatality Rates and a statistical significance for hospital 
capacity/utilization as its p-value as .001 at the 1% significance. Also, the model yielded results 
that show that for an increase of 1% in hospital capacity, Covid-19 fatality rate(s) increases by 
1.20%. In addition, it is evident that there still seems to be a relation between higher fatality rates 
and poverty rates, which is a stemming problem that needs to be addressed sooner rather than 
later. Nonetheless, the significance of the results gathered from this study show that there is still 
needs to be an emphasis placed on having policies and resources to medical centers and states 
that are in need of assistance in times of crisis and epidemics
